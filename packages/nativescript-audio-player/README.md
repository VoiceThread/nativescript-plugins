This plugin provides an audio player for Android and iOS that supports playback of both local files and remote URL audio files. 

```javascript
npm install @voicethread/nativescript-audio-player
```

NOTE: If you want to play an HTTP URL, you'll also need to make some adjustments to your application to allow unsecure connections or URL access will fail silently. 
For iOS, add the following to your app's Info.plist:
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>  
<dict>  
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true />  
</dict>
```

For Android, ensure your application tag in `App_Resources/Android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` has the following:

```
android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
```

## Installation

ns plugin add @angelengineering/audio-player
